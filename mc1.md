# Mini Challenge 1

## Functional pages app

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Your web application should have a home page with a short paragraph explaining the purpose of the site and/or how to use it.
2. Your web application should have an about page with a short blurb or bio about yourself, the developer of the web app.
3. There should be links on the navbar that users can leverage to access the home page, as well as the about page.
4. The home page should be the default page mapped to `/`.

### Note(s)
1. We already have a pages app and it should be installed.
2. There is a directory for pages templates under `templates`.
3. Make sure you have all the necessary views, urlpatterns, templates and configurations to make this happen.
4. *All mini challenges are open book!* You can open a previous assignment and compare (I do not recommend copying and pasting, of course).
